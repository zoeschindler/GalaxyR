Description: On the Galaxy platform many tools and workflows can run directly on a high performance computer. The functions in this package allow to upload data to Galaxy plattforms, invoke workflows, chaeck the status of the workflow and download the results. Credentials (GALAXY_API_KEY, GALAXY_USERNAME, GALAXY_PASSWORD) to the Galaxy platform need to be stored in the .Renviron file first.
